# GitHub Code Search
> A program that searches repos on GitHub

## Description

This program searches through recently updated repos on GitHub. Due to the limited nature of free API calls, a search is first done on repo names based on input from the user. The first nine of those repos are then searched using a second term. For example, searching for repos with 'api' in the name, then searching for 'api_key' within them, will return any mentions of 'api_key' in files under 384k within the repo.
